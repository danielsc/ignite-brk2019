## AzureML and R

This module will show how to use AzureML with R. The AzureML SDK for R has just been released in Preview on github (https://github.com/Azure/azureml-sdk-for-r) and it is still lacking some features. But, for most scenarios, it is already very useful -- for instance it supports experimentation and deployment.

In this module we will be using both the Jupyter and the RStudio instances that are installed on the Notebook VM you set up in the first module of the workshop. 

Before running through this module, please execute the setup script to make sure all required components are installed by opening a Jupyter terminal window and running the following command in the subdirectory `3-r` of this repository:

```
sudo Rscript 0-setup.R
```
